# Placename Insight

A course project aimed at observations from places & their names.

### Problem Description

#### Stats & Facts

- Where are the most densely named areas?
- Which country has the longest average placename length?
- What’s the closest pair of places that shares the same names?
- Does the names containing specific prefixes have limited distribution areas?

#### Location Prediction

- **Regression** – Predicting exact coordinates
- **Classification** – Predicting which country / continent / geographical area it belongs to
- **Clustering** – Determining the “Geographical Area” mentioned above

#### Visualization


### Difficulties

- Converting strings into columns of data / matrix
- Regression to multi-dimensional data
- Polar coordinates
- Possible low accuracy / performance
- More to come…
