# Placename Insights - Report

In the past few decades, the contribution of computers to social productivity mainly lies in its ability to process structural data, such as numerical values, forms, and single colors. People can convert real-life data into structural data and store it in a computer. This liberates a large number of the simplest repetitive workforce.

In recent years, *neural networks* have increased the ability of computers to process non-structural data, or semi-structural data, such as music, images, and text paragraphs; This made abstracting and extracting features of large-scale data possible.

A very important application of machine learning and neural networks is Natural Language Processing. Unlike programming languages, natural language is often more complex, bulky, and difficult to logically describe. The IT industry has introduced abundant research and solutions in this field. When we talk about natural language processing, however, it is usually about a semantic level of processing. In addition to this, there is an area that could be easily overlooked - the abstraction of the *spelling features* of different writing systems.

When searching for available datasets related to language and geographic information, we found an open database provided by GeoNames that provides information of the names, locations, countries, and attributes of a large number of geographic features covering the earth. In this experiment, we used data sets provided by GeoNames, combined with `PyTorch`, `Matplotlib` and other data processing and machine learning tools to study the connection between geographic location and city name.
